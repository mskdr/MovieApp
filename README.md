## Unit Testing
Unit tests are type of automated test that focuses on testing a small unit of code in isolation. The purpose of a unit test is to verify the correctness of individual units of code, such as functions or methods, by testing them in isolation from the rest of the system.

Unit tests have been added for domain and data module.
